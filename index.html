    <h1>About Me</h1>



    <p>I was born in Hartford, Connecticut on January 22nd 1991. I grew up in Manchester, Connecticut with my parents and sisters and still currently reside there. After graduating from Kingswood-Oxford High School in 2009 I was accepted to UConn School of Fine Arts but unfortunately had to drop out the following year for medical reasons.
    </p>
   <p> After recovering from my medical emergencies, I started taking classes at Manchester Community College in pursuit of a Fine Arts Associates Degree. Finished a phlebotomy certification program while continuing my Fine Arts studies.  After acquiring full time employment at Allied Printing, I worked there until the third wave of layoffs hit the company on account of COVID and shortly after I enrolled in UConn Coding Bootcamp with the goal of pursuing a career in web development.
